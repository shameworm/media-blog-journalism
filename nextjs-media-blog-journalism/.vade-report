## React Flight / Next.js RCE Advisory - Patched Version Update

### Project Status: PATCHED SUCCESSFULLY

This project was assessed for vulnerability to the React Flight / Next.js RCE advisory and has been updated to the patched version.

### Vulnerability Assessment

**Detected Dependencies:**
- Next.js: 16.0.1 → 16.0.7 (UPDATED)
- React Flight packages: None detected
- React: 19.2.0 (no change needed)
- React DOM: 19.2.0 (no change needed)

**Vulnerability Status:**
- ✅ Next.js 16.x: Updated from 16.0.1 to patched version 16.0.7
- ✅ React Flight packages: Not used in this project
- ✅ React/React-DOM: Not vulnerable (only affected when used with vulnerable React Flight packages)

### Changes Made

**Files Modified:**
1. `package.json` - Updated Next.js dependencies
   - `next`: 16.0.1 → 16.0.7
   - `eslint-config-next`: 16.0.1 → 16.0.7

2. `package-lock.json` - Updated lockfile to reflect patched versions

**Rationale:**
According to the React Flight / RCE advisory:
- Next.js 16.x requires upgrading to version 16.0.7
- React and React-DOM do not require manual updates in Next.js projects (Next.js supplies correct versions automatically)
- No React Flight packages were detected, so no additional updates were needed

### Build Verification

Verified that the project builds successfully with patched dependencies:
```
✓ Compiled successfully
✓ Generating static pages using 1 worker (19/19) in 1190.1ms
```

### Installed Versions Verification

Confirmed the patched version is installed:
```
npm list next
nextjs-media-blog-journalism@0.1.0
